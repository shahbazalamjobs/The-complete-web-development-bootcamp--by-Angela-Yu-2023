1. **What is PostgreSQL and list down its main features?**

   - PostgreSQL is an Object-Relational Database Management System used in web applications.
   - It is open-source and extends SQL, combining it with various capabilities for complex data workloads.
   - Key features include:
     - Object-relational database support
     - Multi-version concurrency control
     - Procedural languages support
     - Extensibility for SQL and JSON querying

2. **How does PostgreSQL differ from other database management systems?**

   - PostgreSQL emphasizes extensibility and adherence to standards.
   - It supports diverse data types and offers user-defined functions, stored procedures, and custom indexing methods.
   - Active open-source community for development, bug fixes, and updates.

3. **What are the advantages of using PostgreSQL?**

   - Excellent performance and scalability.
   - Advanced features: complex data types, full-text search, geospatial data.
   - Strong data integrity (ACID properties).
   - Highly extensible with custom data types, functions, and procedural languages.
   - Thriving open-source community.
   - Platform-independent (Linux, Windows, macOS).

4. **How do you install PostgreSQL?**

   - Visit official website, download suitable installer.
   - Run installer, follow on-screen instructions.
   - Specify installation directory, set database superuser password.
   - Select components (server, tools, pgAdmin).
   - Complete installation, ensure PostgreSQL service is started.
   - Optionally configure additional settings.

5. **What is a table in PostgreSQL?**

   - A table is a database object storing structured data in rows and columns.
   - It represents a collection of related information organized with predefined structure.
   - Consists of columns (define data types) and rows (contain data entries).

6. **What is a schema in PostgreSQL?**

   - A schema is a named container holding database objects like tables, views, indexes.
   - Provides logical grouping, avoids naming conflicts.
   - Used for partitioning data, managing access privileges, and organizing structures.

7. **How do you create a database in PostgreSQL?**

   - Use SQL command: `CREATE DATABASE database_name;`
   - Replace `database_name` with desired name.
   - Additional options like encoding, owner, or connection limits can be specified.

8. **How do you create a table in PostgreSQL?**

   - Use SQL command:
     ```sql
     CREATE TABLE table_name (
       column1 datatype1,
       column2 datatype2,
       column3 datatype3,
       ...
     );
     ```
   - Replace `table_name` and define columns with data types and optional constraints.

9. **What are functions in PostgreSQL?**

   - Functions execute code on the server.
   - PL/pgSQL and other scripting languages (Perl, Python, PHP) are used.
   - Functions can improve performance using statistical languages like PL/R.

10. **What is the maximum table size in PostgreSQL?**

    - PostgreSQL allows infinite databases but has a maximum table size limit of 32 TB.

11. **What are the different data types supported by PostgreSQL?**
    - PostgreSQL supports a wide range of data types, including:
    - Numeric types: integer, numeric, real, double precision
    - Character types: char, varchar, text
    - Date and time types: date, time, timestamp, interval
    - Boolean type: boolean
    - Binary data types: bytea, bit, bit varying
    - Array types: integer[], text[], etc.
    - JSON and JSONB for storing JSON data
    - UUID for universally unique identifiers
    - Geometric types: point, line, circle, polygon
    - Network address types: inet, CIDR
    - Custom types created by users

12. What are the different data types in PostgreSQL?
    - PostgreSQL supports a myriad of data types:
    - Boolean
    - Numeric Types
    - Character Types
    - Temporal Types
    - Array
    - UUID
    - JSON
    - Store
    - Geometric data and other special types
