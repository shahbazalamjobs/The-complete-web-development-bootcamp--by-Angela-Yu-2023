## SQL code

### Unique and Not Null
```sql
CREATE TABLE world_food (
    id SERIAL PRIMARY KEY,
    country VARCHAR(45) UNIQUE NOT NULL, -- Unique and not null constraint for the country column
    rice DOUBLE PRECISION,
    wheat DOUBLE PRECISION
);
```

### Like 

In PostgreSQL, the `LIKE` keyword is used in conjunction with the `WHERE` clause to perform pattern matching in a query. It allows you to search for a specified pattern within a column.

Here's a simple breakdown:

- **Basic Syntax:**
  ```sql
  SELECT * FROM table_name WHERE column_name LIKE pattern;
  ```

- **Wildcard Characters:**
  - `%`: Represents zero or more characters.
  - `_`: Represents a single character.

- **Examples:**
  - `WHERE column_name LIKE 'abc%'`: Finds any values that start with "abc."
  - `WHERE column_name LIKE '%xyz'`: Finds any values that end with "xyz."
  - `WHERE column_name LIKE '%key%'`: Finds any values that have "key" in any position.
  - `WHERE column_name LIKE '_a%'`: Finds any values that have "a" in the second position.
  - `WHERE column_name LIKE 'a_%_%'`: Finds any values that start with "a" and are at least three characters in length.

- **Case Sensitivity:**
  By default, `LIKE` is case-sensitive. If you want a case-insensitive search, you can use the `ILIKE` keyword instead.

Here's an example to illustrate:

```sql
SELECT * FROM employees WHERE first_name LIKE 'J%';
```

This query retrieves all rows from the "employees" table where the "first_name" column starts with 'J'.

Remember, the `LIKE` operator is quite powerful for flexible pattern matching, and you can get creative with the patterns to suit your specific needs.
