## Database

- In full-stack development, a database is a crucial component that stores and manages the data used by an application. Here are some fundamental concepts related to databases in the context of full-stack development:

1. **Relational Databases:**
   - Relational databases, such as MySQL, PostgreSQL, and SQLite, are widely used in full-stack development.
   - Data is organized into tables, and relationships between tables are established using keys (primary keys and foreign keys).

2. **Database Management System (DBMS):**
   - A DBMS is software that enables the creation, retrieval, update, and management of databases. Common examples include MySQL, PostgreSQL, MongoDB, and Microsoft SQL Server.

3. **SQL (Structured Query Language):**
   - SQL is the language used to interact with relational databases. It provides a standardized way to perform operations like querying, updating, and deleting data.

4. **Schema:**
   - A database schema defines the structure of the database, including tables, fields, and relationships. It acts as a blueprint for the database.

5. **CRUD Operations:**
   - CRUD stands for Create, Read, Update, and Deleteâ€”the basic operations performed on data in a database.

6. **APIs for Database Interaction:**
   - In full-stack development, server-side code interacts with the database. This interaction is often done through APIs (Application Programming Interfaces) using languages like Node.js, Python, or Java.

7. **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping):**
   - ORM is a technique that allows developers to interact with a database using an object-oriented programming language. It maps database tables to classes, and instances of these classes represent records in the database. Examples include Sequelize for Node.js and Hibernate for Java.

8. **Connection Pooling:**
   - Connection pooling is a technique used to efficiently manage and reuse database connections. It helps improve performance by avoiding the overhead of opening and closing a new database connection for each request.

9. **Indexes:**
   - Indexes improve the speed of data retrieval operations by providing a quick lookup mechanism. They are created on specific columns in a table.

10. **Normalization:**
    - Normalization is the process of organizing data in a database to reduce redundancy and dependency. It involves dividing large tables into smaller ones and defining relationships between them.

11. **NoSQL Databases:**
    - In addition to relational databases, full-stack developers may encounter NoSQL databases like MongoDB, which use non-tabular structures for storage and retrieval of data.

12. **Transactions:**
    - Transactions ensure the atomicity, consistency, isolation, and durability (ACID properties) of database operations. They are critical for maintaining the integrity of data.

Understanding these concepts is essential for full-stack developers, as they work with both the front-end and back-end of an application, and data management plays a crucial role in the overall functionality of the system.

## Comparison between SQL (Structured Query Language) and NoSQL databases:

| Feature                        | SQL                                     | NoSQL                                       |
|--------------------------------|-----------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| **Data Structure**             | Relational tables with predefined schema | Dynamic schema, typically using JSON or BSON |
| **Schema**                     | Fixed and structured                     | Dynamic and flexible                         |
| **Query Language**             | SQL (Structured Query Language)          | Varies by database type (e.g., MongoDB uses JSON-like queries) |
| **Scaling**                    | Vertical scaling (increasing hardware)   | Horizontal scaling (adding more machines to a network) |
| **Data Relationship**          | Emphasizes on relationships between tables (primary/foreign keys) | Emphasizes on denormalization and may not enforce relationships |
| **Transactions**               | ACID compliant (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) | May be ACID compliant, but some may prioritize performance over strict consistency (BASE model) |
| **Use Cases**                  | Well-suited for complex queries and transactions | Well-suited for large amounts of unstructured or semi-structured data, and for distributed and scalable systems |
| **Examples**                   | MySQL, PostgreSQL, Oracle                | MongoDB, Cassandra, CouchDB                   |

## Differences in code syntax between SQL and NoSQL databases, focusing on basic operations:

| Operation                       | SQL                                         | NoSQL (MongoDB as an example)                    |
|---------------------------------|---------------------------------------------|--------------------------------------------------|
| **Create a Database**            | `CREATE DATABASE dbname;`                   | Database creation is automatic when a collection is first created. No separate database creation command.|
| **Create a Collection/Table**    | `CREATE TABLE tablename (column1 datatype, column2 datatype, ...);` | `db.createCollection("collectionName");`          |
| **Insert Data**                  | `INSERT INTO tablename (column1, column2, ...) VALUES (value1, value2, ...);` | `db.collectionName.insert({ key1: value1, key2: value2, ... });` |
| **Query Data**                   | `SELECT * FROM tablename WHERE condition;`  | `db.collectionName.find({ key: value });`       |
| **Update Data**                  | `UPDATE tablename SET column1 = value WHERE condition;` | `db.collectionName.update({ key: value }, { $set: { newKey: newValue }});` |
| **Delete Data**                  | `DELETE FROM tablename WHERE condition;`    | `db.collectionName.remove({ key: value });`    |
| **Joins**                        | Supports joins across tables using `JOIN` keyword | No built-in join operations; data denormalization is often used. |
| **Schema Modification**          | `ALTER TABLE tablename ADD COLUMN new_column datatype;` | Dynamic schema, no explicit schema modification needed. New fields can be added without a predefined schema. |
| **Transactions**                 | Supports transactions with `BEGIN TRANSACTION`, `COMMIT`, and `ROLLBACK` | Limited support for multi-document transactions. Operations are often atomic at the document level. |
