# Introduction to CSS

- CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets. It is a styling language used to describe the presentation of a document written in HTML or XML. CSS can be used to control the layout, colors, fonts, and other visual aspects of web pages.

- CSS is an important part of modern web development because it allows designers and developers to separate the presentation of a web page from its content. This separation makes it easier to maintain and update web pages, as changes to the visual design can be made in the CSS file without affecting the underlying HTML content.

- CSS works by selecting HTML elements and applying styles to them. Styles can be applied to elements based on their tag names, class names, IDs, or other attributes. CSS also supports a wide range of selectors and styling properties that allow for fine-grained control over the appearance of web pages.

- CSS is typically included in an HTML document using a <link> tag in the <head> section of the document. External CSS files can also be linked to multiple HTML documents, allowing for consistent styling across an entire website.

- Overall, CSS is an essential tool for creating modern, responsive, and visually appealing web pages.

| Separation of presentation from content | CSS allows designers to separate the presentation (visual design) of a web page from its content, making it easier to maintain and update. |
| Selectors | Used to select HTML elements to apply styles to. Examples include tag names, class names, and IDs. |

| Cascading | Refers to the way styles are applied in a hierarchical manner, with styles defined closer to an element taking precedence over more general styles. |
| Inheritance | Allows styles to be inherited by child elements from their parent elements. |
| Box model | Refers to the way HTML elements are rendered as rectangular boxes with content, padding, borders, and margin. |
| Layout | Refers to the arrangement of HTML elements on a web page. CSS provides a range of layout options, such as float, display, and flexbox. |
| Media queries | Used to apply different styles to a web page based on the size or orientation of the device it's being viewed on. |
