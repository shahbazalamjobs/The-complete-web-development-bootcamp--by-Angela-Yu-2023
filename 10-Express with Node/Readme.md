# Express Js

Express.js is a popular web application framework for Node.js, designed to simplify the process of building web applications and APIs. It provides a set of tools and features that help developers handle various aspects of web development, such as routing, middleware, request and response handling, and more. <br>

Key Features and Concepts of Express.js:

1. **Routing**: Express.js allows you to define routes for different URLs and HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE, etc.). Each route can have associated handler functions that execute when a request matches that route.

2. **Middleware**: Middleware functions are executed in a sequence for every incoming request. They can perform various tasks such as authentication, logging, data parsing, and error handling. Middleware functions can be applied globally to the entire application or to specific routes.

3. **Request and Response Handling**: Express provides a simplified way to handle incoming HTTP requests and send responses. It offers methods for setting headers, sending data, and handling different content types.

4. **Templates and Rendering**: Express supports template engines like EJS, Pug (formerly known as Jade), and others. These engines enable you to dynamically generate HTML by injecting data into templates.

5. **Static Files**: You can serve static files (like CSS, JavaScript, images) using Express's built-in middleware. This simplifies the process of delivering client-side assets.

6. **Routing Parameters**: Express allows you to define routes with parameters that can be extracted from the URL. This is useful for creating dynamic routes and handling variable data.

7. **Error Handling**: Express provides mechanisms to handle errors and exceptions, both for synchronous and asynchronous operations. This helps you create more robust applications.

8. **RESTful APIs**: Express is commonly used for building RESTful APIs due to its flexibility in handling routes and HTTP methods.

Getting Started with Express.js:

To use Express.js, you typically need to follow these steps:

1. **Install Express**: Install Express.js as a dependency in your Node.js project using a package manager like npm.

2. **Create an Express App**: Create an instance of an Express application using `express()`.

3. **Define Routes**: Define routes using the HTTP methods (GET, POST, etc.) and associate them with handler functions.

4. **Middleware**: Add middleware functions to handle tasks like parsing request data, authentication, logging, and more.

5. **Start Server**: Start the Express server by listening on a specific port using the `app.listen()` method.

Example Code:

```javascript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

app.get('/', (req, res) => {
  res.send('Hello, Express!');
});

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server is listening on port 3000');
});
```

In this example, when a GET request is made to the root URL ('/'), the server responds with "Hello, Express!".

Express.js is known for its simplicity, flexibility, and vibrant ecosystem. It has a large community and a wealth of third-party packages that can be easily integrated to extend its functionality. It's a great choice for building web applications and APIs using Node.js.

### Creating server using Express

```js
import express from "express";
const app = express();
const port = 3000;

// app.listen(3000, () => {     // without var port 
//     console.log("Server running on port 3000.");
// });

app.listen(port, () => {
    console.log(`Server running on port ${port}.`)
});

// o/p: Cannot GET /
```
