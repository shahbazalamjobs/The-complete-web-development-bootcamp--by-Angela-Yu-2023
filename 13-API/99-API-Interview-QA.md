Sure, here are 15 API-related interview questions along with brief answers:

1. **What is an API?**
   - *Answer:* An API (Application Programming Interface) is a set of rules and tools that allows different software applications to communicate with each other.

2. **Explain RESTful API.**
   - *Answer:* REST (Representational State Transfer) is an architectural style for designing networked applications. A RESTful API adheres to the principles of REST, using standard HTTP methods (GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) for communication.

3. **What is the difference between GET and POST requests?**
   - *Answer:* GET is used for requesting data from a specified resource, while POST is used for submitting data to be processed.

4. **How does OAuth work?**
   - *Answer:* OAuth is an authentication protocol that allows third-party applications to obtain limited access to a user's account. It works by delegating user authentication to the service that hosts the user account and authorizing third-party applications to access that account.

5. **What is JSON?**
   - *Answer:* JSON (JavaScript Object Notation) is a lightweight data-interchange format that is easy for humans to read and write and easy for machines to parse and generate. It's often used for data exchange between a server and a web application.

6. **Explain the term "Endpoint" in the context of APIs.**
   - *Answer:* An endpoint is a specific URL or URI (Uniform Resource Identifier) that represents a specific function or resource in an API. It's the access point to the functionality provided by the API.

7. **What is the purpose of HTTP status codes in API responses?**
   - *Answer:* HTTP status codes indicate the outcome of a request. For example, a 200 status code means the request was successful, while a 404 code indicates that the requested resource was not found.

8. **How does CORS work, and why is it important in the context of APIs?**
   - *Answer:* CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) is a security feature implemented by web browsers to control which web applications are allowed to access resources on a given server. It prevents potential security risks associated with cross-origin HTTP requests.

9. **What is the difference between SOAP and REST?**
   - *Answer:* SOAP (Simple Object Access Protocol) is a protocol for exchanging structured information in web services, often using XML. REST, on the other hand, is an architectural style that uses standard HTTP methods and is more lightweight.

10. **Explain the concept of Rate Limiting in APIs.**
    - *Answer:* Rate limiting is a technique used to control the number of requests a client can make to an API within a specified time period. It helps prevent abuse, ensure fair usage, and maintain system performance.

11. **How does JWT (JSON Web Token) work in authentication?**
    - *Answer:* JWT is a compact, URL-safe means of representing claims to be transferred between two parties. In authentication, it's often used as a token containing user information to verify the user's identity.

12. **What is the purpose of the OPTIONS HTTP method?**
    - *Answer:* The OPTIONS method is used to describe the communication options for the target resource. It's often used in the context of CORS to check if the actual request is safe to send.

13. **Explain the difference between PUT and PATCH HTTP methods.**
    - *Answer:* PUT is used to update or create a resource entirely, while PATCH is used to apply partial modifications to a resource.

14. **What is the role of API documentation, and why is it important?**
    - *Answer:* API documentation provides information on how to use an API, including endpoints, request/response formats, authentication methods, and examples. It's crucial for developers to understand how to interact with an API effectively.

15. **How can you secure an API?**
    - *Answer:* API security involves measures such as using HTTPS, implementing authentication (e.g., OAuth, API keys), validating and sanitizing inputs, encrypting sensitive data, and setting up proper access controls.
