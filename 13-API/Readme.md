### API

- API, short for Application Programming Interface, is like a secret handshake for software.
- It allows different applications to communicate with each other and share data or functionality.
- APIs define the methods and data formats that applications can use to request and exchange information.

- Use postman and provide api url and send the get request to get the details
- Postman can be use to test api without frontend and backend.
