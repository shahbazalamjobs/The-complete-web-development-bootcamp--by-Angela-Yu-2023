# Unix
## Shell and the kernel in Unix-like operating systems.
Certainly! Here's a concise explanation of shell, command-line interface, and kernel:

**Shell:**
- The shell is a command interpreter that lets users interact with an operating system.
- It takes user commands, interprets them, and communicates with the kernel to execute those commands.
- Shells can be used for running programs, managing files, and automating tasks.
- Examples include Bash, Zsh, and Fish.

**Command-Line Interface (CLI):**
- A text-based interface where users input commands using a keyboard.
- Allows direct interaction with the computer's operating system.
- Users type commands, and the system responds with text-based output.
- Offers powerful control and flexibility for tasks like file manipulation, process management, and system configuration.

**Kernel:**
- The core component of an operating system.
- Manages hardware resources and provides essential services to software.
- Controls tasks like process scheduling, memory management, and device communication.
- Acts as a bridge between hardware and software layers, executing system calls from user programs.

Remember, these components work together: the shell provides a user-friendly way to interact with the kernel through the command-line interface.

## Bash commands
- Simple: <br>
`mkdir Music` : making a new directory (makes a new folder called Music in current location) <br>
`pwd` : current directory <br>
`ls` : shows all folder <br>
`ls -a :` shows all files including hidden ones <br>


- Directory: <br>
`cd /` : brings you to highest level of hierarchy (in my Pc it brings me to /MINGW64) <br>
`cd ..` : brings you to previous folder <br>
`cd c:` : Users/hp/OneDrive/Desktop : bring directly to Desktop location <br>
`cd c:`  : takes you to c drive folder <br>

- Files: <br>
`touch document.txt` : Creates a file name document.txt <br>
`rm document.txt` : Deletes file name document.txt if it's present in current directory <br>
`code array.c` : Creates a code file called array.c and it opens in vscode <br>
`rm array.c` : remove file name array.c <br>
`rm *` : removes all file inside the directory but not the folders <br>
 `rm *` : `is quite dangerous so  be careful while using it, check the directory you are` <br>
`rm -r document.txt` : remove file name document.txt in current directory <br>
