### Git 
- Git is a version control system that tracks changes in your code.
- It helps you collaborate with a team, undo mistakes, and manage different project versions.
- With commands like git add, git commit, and git push, you can control, save, and share your code efficiently.
- It's like a time machine for your project, ensuring smooth development and collaboration.

### Version control
- Version control is like having a time machine for your code.
- It allows you to track changes, collaborate with others, and rewind to previous states if things go south.
- Imagine you're working on a project, and you decide to make some changes. Without version control, you might end up with multiple copies of files, confusion about who did what, and the constant fear of messing things up irreversibly.


`Git is used to control repository, track all changes, commit all changes and to perform version control`.
