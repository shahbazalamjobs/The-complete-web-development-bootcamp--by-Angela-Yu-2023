
### Branching and merging

1. There is main which is default branch earlier used to be master
2. Then we have branch where we can work on features, bug fixes, or experiments without affecting the main project.
3. Create branch: `git branch branch-name`
4. To move to another branch: `git checkout branch-name` <br> or `git checkout branch main`
5. Then make changes in side branch and then commit: `git commit -m "Update file"`
6. Merge side branch to main branch: `git merge branch-name`
7. Send the local repo to remote repo i.e. GitHub: `git push origin main`
