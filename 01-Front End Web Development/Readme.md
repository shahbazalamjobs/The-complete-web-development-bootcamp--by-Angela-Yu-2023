# Frontend Development

Front-end development refers to the process of designing and building the user-facing part of a website or application. This includes everything that a user sees and interacts with on a website, such as the layout, colors, typography, buttons, forms, and other user interface (UI) elements.

Front-end developers use a variety of programming languages and technologies, such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, to create these UI elements and make them functional. They also need to ensure that the website or application is responsive, meaning it displays properly on different devices and screen sizes.

Browser Compatibility: Front-end developers must consider browser compatibility when developing a website or application, as different browsers may interpret code differently. It's important to test the website or application on different browsers and versions to ensure that it works properly.

Frameworks and Libraries: Front-end developers often use frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, to simplify the development process and improve efficiency. These tools provide pre-built UI components and functionality that can be customized and integrated into a project.

Performance: Front-end developers must optimize the performance of a website or application by minimizing load times, reducing file sizes, and using efficient coding practices. This is important for providing a fast and smooth user experience, especially on mobile devices.

Accessibility: Front-end developers should ensure that a website or application is accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. This involves using proper semantic markup, providing alternative text for images and videos, and ensuring keyboard navigation and screen reader compatibility.

# Important points in Frontend development

HTML: HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) is the foundation of front-end development, and is used to structure and format content on a website or application.

CSS: CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style HTML elements, such as text, colors, layouts, and more. It's an important topic for front-end developers to understand, as it helps to create a visually appealing and user-friendly interface.

JavaScript: JavaScript is a programming language that is used to add interactivity and dynamic functionality to a website or application. It's an essential topic for front-end developers to learn, as it allows them to create complex features and interactions on a website.

Responsive Design: Responsive design is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that are optimized for different screen sizes, such as desktops, laptops, tablets, and mobile devices. It's an important topic for front-end developers to understand, as it helps to create a seamless and user-friendly experience for website visitors.

Web Accessibility: Web accessibility is the practice of designing and developing websites and applications that are accessible to all users, including those with disabilities. Front-end developers need to understand the principles of web accessibility and ensure that their websites and applications are compliant with accessibility standards.

Version Control: Version control is the practice of managing changes to code and files over time. Front-end developers should learn how to use version control systems, such as Git, to collaborate with other developers and keep track of changes to their code.

Frameworks and Libraries: Front-end developers should be familiar with popular front-end frameworks and libraries, such as React, Angular, Vue.js, and Bootstrap. These tools can help developers streamline their workflow and create more efficient and scalable projects.

# How does the internet work

The internet is a global network of computers and servers that communicate with each other using a standardized set of protocols. Here is a simplified explanation of how the internet works:

Devices: The internet is accessed through various devices such as computers, smartphones, and tablets, which are connected to the internet via Wi-Fi or cellular networks.

ISP: An Internet Service Provider (ISP) provides internet connectivity to devices through wired or wireless connections. ISPs are connected to other networks around the world and exchange data with each other to ensure that all devices are able to access the internet.

Protocols: The internet uses a standardized set of protocols such as TCP/IP, HTTP, and FTP to transmit data between devices. These protocols ensure that data is transmitted in a reliable and secure manner.

DNS: The Domain Name System (DNS) is responsible for converting human-readable domain names (e.g. google.com) into machine-readable IP addresses (e.g. 216.58.194.174). This allows devices to connect to web servers and other devices on the internet.

Routing: Data is transmitted between devices using a process called routing. When a device sends data, it is divided into small packets and sent to the nearest router. The router then forwards the packets to the next router until they reach their destination.

Web servers: Web servers are computers that store and serve web pages and other content over the internet. When a user types a URL into their web browser, the browser sends a request to the appropriate web server, which then sends the requested content back to the user's device.

Encryption: To ensure that data transmitted over the internet is secure, encryption is used to scramble the data so that it cannot be intercepted or read by unauthorized parties. Common encryption protocols include SSL and TLS.

Overall, the internet is a complex system that relies on a variety of technologies and protocols to ensure that data is transmitted reliably and securely between devices around the world.

## Example of how does internet works

Let's say you want to access a website such as Google.com. Here's what happens when you type the URL into your web browser:

Your computer sends a request to your Internet Service Provider (ISP) asking for the IP address of the Google.com website.

The ISP checks its cache to see if it has the IP address for Google.com. If it doesn't, it forwards the request to other DNS (Domain Name System) servers until it 
finds the IP address for the website.

Once your computer has the IP address for Google.com, it sends a request to the web server hosting the website.

The web server responds by sending back the website's HTML, CSS, and JavaScript code.

Your web browser then interprets the code and displays the website on your computer.

This entire process happens within seconds and is repeated millions of times every day across the internet.
