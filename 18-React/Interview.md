## Q1. Features of React  
- Its virtual DOM boosts performance by minimizing actual DOM manipulations.
- The component-based architecture promotes modular and reusable code, enhancing maintainability.
- React's one-way data flow simplifies state management, reducing potential bugs.
- The JSX syntax allows for a seamless blend of HTML and JavaScript, making the code more readable.
- Additionally, React has strong community support and is backed by Facebook, ensuring continuous updates and improvements. These factors collectively make React a powerful and popular choice for building dynamic and efficient user interfaces.


## Q2. Why React was made

- React was introduced by Facebook to address challenges in building large, dynamic interfaces.
- Developers needed a solution that could efficiently update the UI in response to changing data
- The virtual DOM was introduced for efficient UI updates.
- React's declarative approach simplified development by allowing developers to describe the desired state.
- Improved code predictability


## Q3. What problems Javascript had that react solved

- Inefficient DOM Manipulation: Traditional JavaScript frameworks manipulated the DOM directly, causing performance bottlenecks. React's virtual DOM optimized this process, updating only the necessary parts for improved efficiency.
- Complex UI Logic: Handling complex UI logic and state management in JavaScript was error-prone. React's component-based architecture and declarative syntax simplified UI development, making code more modular and readable.
- Data Synchronization: Keeping UI in sync with changing data was a challenge. React's one-way data flow and virtual DOM ensured efficient data synchronization, reducing bugs and enhancing predictability.
- Code Maintainability: As applications grew, maintaining and organizing JavaScript code became challenging. React's component-based structure promoted code modularity, reusability, and easier maintenance
