Certainly! The `forEach` method in ES6 is used to iterate over the elements of an array and execute a provided function once for each element. It's a convenient way to perform an operation on each element without the need for an explicit loop.

Here's the basic syntax and an example:

**Syntax:**
```javascript
array.forEach((currentValue, index, array) => {
  // Code to execute for each element
});
```

- `currentValue`: The current element being processed in the array.
- `index`: The index of the current element being processed.
- `array`: The array `forEach` was called upon.

**Example:**
```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((num, index) => {
  console.log(`Element at index ${index}: ${num}`);
});
// Output:
// Element at index 0: 1
// Element at index 1: 2
// Element at index 2: 3
// Element at index 3: 4
```

In this example, the `forEach` method is used to iterate over the `numbers` array, and for each element, a message is logged to the console with the element's value and index.

You can also use an arrow function for more concise syntax:

```javascript
const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4];

numbers.forEach((num) => console.log(num));
// Output:
// 1
// 2
// 3
// 4
```

The `forEach` method is useful when you want to perform a side effect for each element in the array, such as logging values, updating external variables, or triggering other actions. Keep in mind that `forEach` doesn't create a new array; it's primarily used for its side effects during iteration.
