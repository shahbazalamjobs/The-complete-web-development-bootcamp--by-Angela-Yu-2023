## DOM

- If script tag is present in head section then it may lead to problems of slow loading of website.
- When interpreter reaches the script tag in head, it has to change some properties of element (element which is not known and leads to error)
Certainly! Here are three key points to consider when placing the `<script>` tag in the `<head>` section of your HTML document:

1. **Blocking Page Rendering**: Placing `<script>` tags in the `<head>` can block the rendering of the page until the JavaScript is loaded and executed, potentially slowing down the page load time and user experience.
2. **JavaScript Dependencies**: If your scripts have dependencies on elements defined in the `<body>` section, placing them in the `<head>` might lead to errors, as those elements might not be available when the scripts execute.
3. **Perceived Page Load Time**: Placing JavaScript in the `<head>` can give the impression of a slower page load, as users might see an incomplete or blank page while waiting for the JavaScript to load and execute.

While there are cases where placing scripts in the `<head>` can be appropriate, it's generally recommended to include scripts just before the closing `</body>` tag to optimize page loading and improve user experience.
