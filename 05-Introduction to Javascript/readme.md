### Alert
- In JavaScript, the `alert()` function is a built-in method that allows you to display a dialog box with a message to the user. The dialog box typically contains an "OK" button, and the message you provide will be shown to the user as a simple notification.

Here's the basic syntax of the `alert()` function:

```javascript
alert(message);
```

- `message`: This is the string or message that you want to display in the alert dialog box.

Example usage:

```javascript
alert("Hello, world!"); // Displays an alert box with the message "Hello, world!"

let age = 25;
alert("Your age is: " + age); // Displays an alert box with the message "Your age is: 25"
```

### Datatypes in Javascript

In JavaScript, there are several data types that define the type of data that a variable or expression can hold. JavaScript is a dynamically typed language, which means that variables can hold values of different types during the program execution. The main data types in JavaScript are as follows:

1. **Primitive Data Types:**
   These data types are immutable, meaning their values cannot be changed once they are created.

   - **Number:** Represents both integer and floating-point numbers. Examples: `5`, `3.14`, `-10`.
   - **String:** Represents a sequence of characters, enclosed in single ('') or double ("") quotes. Examples: `'Hello'`, `"JavaScript"`.
   - **Boolean:** Represents a logical value, either `true` or `false`.
   - **Undefined:** Represents a variable that has been declared but not assigned a value.
   - **Null:** Represents the intentional absence of any object value.
   - **Symbol:** Represents a unique, immutable value used as an identifier for object properties (introduced in ECMAScript 6).

2. **Object Data Type:**
   Objects are more complex data types that can store multiple key-value pairs and represent more elaborate data structures. Objects are created using curly braces `{}`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let person = {
       name: "John",
       age: 30,
       isStudent: false
   };
   ```

3. **Array Data Type:**
   Arrays are used to store multiple values in a single variable. They can hold values of different types and are created using square brackets `[]`.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5];
   let fruits = ["apple", "banana", "orange"];
   ```

4. **Function Data Type:**
   Functions are a special type of object that can be invoked (called) to perform a specific task or return a value.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function add(a, b) {
       return a + b;
   }
   ```

5. **Date Data Type:**
   Represents a specific date and time. It is often used for working with dates and times.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let currentDate = new Date();
   ```

JavaScript is a loosely typed language, meaning you do not need to specify the data type explicitly when declaring a variable. The data type of a variable is determined automatically based on the value assigned to it. However, you can use the `typeof` operator to check the type of a variable or expression at runtime.

Example:
```javascript
let num = 10;
let message = "Hello";
console.log(typeof num); // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof message); // Output: "string"
```
---
`typeof` operator is used to determine the data type of a value or variable
```js
let value1 = 42;
let value2 = "Hello";
let value3 = true;
let value4 = { key: "value" };

console.log(typeof value1); // Output: "number"
console.log(typeof value2); // Output: "string"
console.log(typeof value3); // Output: "boolean"
console.log(typeof value4); // Output: "object"

```
### Variable

1. **Variables:**
   - Variables are used to store and manipulate data in JavaScript.
   - They act as named containers that hold values.
   - In JavaScript, you can declare variables using `var`, `let`, or `const` keywords.

2. **Declaring a Variable:**
   - Use `var`, `let`, or `const` to declare a variable, followed by the variable name.
   - Variables declared with `var` and `let` can change their values, while `const` variables are read-only (immutable).

   Example:
   ```javascript
   var age = 30;
   let name = "John";
   const pi = 3.14;
   ```

3. **Assigning Values:**
   - You can assign values to variables using the assignment operator (`=`).

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let num = 42;
   let message = "Hello, world!";
   ```

4. **Changing Values:**
   - Variables declared with `var` or `let` can have their values changed or updated.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let count = 10;
   count = count + 1; // Now count is 11
   ```

5. **Constant Variables (`const`):**
   - Variables declared with `const` cannot be reassigned after their initial value.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   const appName = "My App";
   // appName = "New App"; // This will result in an error
   ```

6. **Variable Scope:**
   - The scope of a variable determines its accessibility within the code.
   - Variables declared with `var` have function scope, while those declared with `let` or `const` have block scope.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   function exampleFunction() {
       var x = 10; // x is accessible inside this function
       let y = 20; // y is accessible only within this block
       if (true) {
           var z = 30; // z is accessible within the entire function
           console.log(y); // Output: 20
       }
       console.log(z); // Output: 30
   }
   ```

### Swap 2 variable values
To swap the values of two variables in JavaScript, you can use a temporary variable to store one of the values temporarily. Here's a simple code example to swap the values of two variables:

```javascript
let a = 10;
let b = 20;

console.log("Before swapping:");
console.log("a:", a); // Output: 10
console.log("b:", b); // Output: 20

// Swapping using a temporary variable
let temp = a;
a = b;
b = temp;

console.log("After swapping:");
console.log("a:", a); // Output: 20
console.log("b:", b); // Output: 10
```

- Values of `a` and `b` are initially set to 10 and 20, respectively.
- We then use the `temp` variable to temporarily store the value of `a`.
- Next, we assign the value of `b` to `a`, effectively swapping their values.
- Finally, we assign the value stored in `temp` (the original value of `a`) to `b`, completing the swap.

After the swapping process, the variables `a` and `b` will hold each other's values.

### Naming variables in JavaScript and common naming conventions:

1. **Naming Variables:**
   - Choose meaningful and descriptive names for variables that reflect their purpose.
   - Use camelCase notation, starting with a lowercase letter, for multi-word variable names.
   - Variables must start with a letter, underscore (_), or dollar sign ($) and can be followed by letters, digits, underscores, or dollar signs.

2. **Good Examples:**
   ```javascript
   let firstName = "John";
   let itemCount = 10;
   let isValidUser = true;
   ```

3. **Bad Examples:**
   ```javascript
   let x = "John"; // Not descriptive
   let count_1 = 5; // Contains underscore
   let user$ = "Alice"; // Contains dollar sign
   ```

4. **Constants:**
   - For constants, use UPPERCASE letters with underscores for separating words.
   - Constants are typically declared using the `const` keyword.
  
   ```javascript
   const PI = 3.14;
   const MAX_SIZE = 100;
   ```

5. **Avoid Reserved Keywords:**
   - Do not use JavaScript reserved keywords as variable names since they have special meanings in the language.

   ```javascript
   // Bad: Reserved keyword as variable name
   let function = "test";
   ```

6. **Use Meaningful Abbreviations (If Necessary):**
   - Only use abbreviations that are widely recognized and make the code more readable.
   - Avoid cryptic or ambiguous abbreviations.

   ```javascript
   // Good: Abbreviation for "index"
   let idx = 0;
   ```

7. **Consistency:**
   - Be consistent with your naming conventions throughout the codebase.
   - Use the same naming style for variables of similar types or purposes.

   ```javascript
   let firstName = "John";
   let lastName = "Doe";
   let age = 30;

   let isValid = true;
   let hasPermission = false;
   ```

---

1. **Valid Variable Names:**
   - Must start with a letter (a-z, A-Z) or an underscore (_).
   - Can be followed by letters, digits (0-9), underscores (_), or dollar signs ($).
   - Variable names are case-sensitive, so `myVar`, `MyVar`, and `MYVAR` are considered different variables.
   - Cannot be a JavaScript reserved keyword (e.g., `if`, `else`, `while`, `function`, etc.).

2. **Examples of Valid Variable Names:**
   ```javascript
   let age = 25;
   let firstName = "John";
   let _count = 10;
   let $price = 19.99;
   let thisIsAValidVariableName = true;
   ```

3. **Invalid Variable Names:**
   ```javascript
   // These are invalid variable names in JavaScript
   let 123invalid = "Invalid"; // Cannot start with a digit
   let my-var = "Invalid"; // Hyphens are not allowed
   let if = 42; // "if" is a reserved keyword
   ```
---

### String concatenation 

1. **Using the `+` Operator:**
   You can use the `+` operator to concatenate two or more strings.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let firstName = "John";
   let lastName = "Doe";
   let fullName = firstName + " " + lastName;
   console.log(fullName); // Output: "John Doe"
   ```

2. **Using the `+=` Operator:**
   The `+=` operator is a shorthand for concatenation and assignment. It appends a string to an existing variable.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let message = "Hello, ";
   message += "world!";
   console.log(message); // Output: "Hello, world!"
   ```

3. **Using Template Literals (ES6+):**
   Template literals allow you to embed expressions within backticks (`) and use placeholders `${}` to insert variables or expressions directly into the string.

   Example:
   ```javascript
   let name = "Alice";
   let greeting = `Hello, ${name}!`;
   console.log(greeting); // Output: "Hello, Alice!"
   ```

## String Length

- JavaScript provides a `length` property for strings to determine their length.
- The `length` property returns the number of characters in the string, including spaces and special characters.
- To get the length of a string, access the `length` property of the string variable.

```js
let myString = "Hello, World!";
let lengthOfString = myString.length;
console.log(lengthOfString); // Output: 13
```
---

## UpperCase and LowerCase
- We can convert strings to uppercase and lowercase using the `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()` methods, respectively.
- These methods return new strings with all alphabetic characters in the original string converted to the desired case, while non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.

Here's how to use `toUpperCase()` and `toLowerCase()`:

1. To convert a string to uppercase:
```javascript
let originalString = "Hello, World!";
let upperCaseString = originalString.toUpperCase();

console.log(upperCaseString); // Output: HELLO, WORLD!
```

2. To convert a string to lowercase:
```javascript
let originalString = "Hello, World!";
let lowerCaseString = originalString.toLowerCase();

console.log(lowerCaseString); // Output: hello, world!
```
---
- Basic arithmetic operations like addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and more using standard arithmetic operators.

1. Addition (+):
```javascript
let num1 = 5;
let num2 = 10;
let sum = num1 + num2;

console.log(sum); // Output: 15
```

2. Subtraction (-):
```javascript
let num1 = 20;
let num2 = 8;
let difference = num1 - num2;

console.log(difference); // Output: 12
```

3. Multiplication (*):
```javascript
let num1 = 4;
let num2 = 6;
let product = num1 * num2;

console.log(product); // Output: 24
```

4. Division (/):
```javascript
let num1 = 15;
let num2 = 3;
let quotient = num1 / num2;

console.log(quotient); // Output: 5
```

5. Modulus (%):
```javascript
let num1 = 17;
let num2 = 5;
let remainder = num1 % num2;

console.log(remainder); // Output: 2
```

6. Exponentiation (**):
```javascript
let base = 2;
let exponent = 3;
let result = base ** exponent;

console.log(result); // Output: 8 (2^3)
```

---

**Increment (++) Operator:**

1. Prefix Increment (`++variable`): The variable is increased by 1 before its current value is used.

```javascript
var num = 5;
var result = ++num;

console.log(result); // Output: 6
console.log(num);    // Output: 6 (num was incremented by 1)
```

2. Postfix Increment (`variable++`): The current value of the variable is used, and then it is increased by 1.

```javascript
var num = 5;
var result = num++;

console.log(result); // Output: 5 (num's current value was used)
console.log(num);    // Output: 6 (num was incremented by 1)
```

**Decrement (--) Operator:**

1. Prefix Decrement (`--variable`): The variable is decreased by 1 before its current value is used.

```javascript
var num = 10;
var result = --num;

console.log(result); // Output: 9
console.log(num);    // Output: 9 (num was decremented by 1)
```

2. Postfix Decrement (`variable--`): The current value of the variable is used, and then it is decreased by 1.

```javascript
var num = 10;
var result = num--;

console.log(result); // Output: 10 (num's current value was used)
console.log(num);    // Output: 9 (num was decremented by 1)
```

---

The code `x += 5` is a shorthand notation for incrementing the value of the variable `x` by 5. 
It is equivalent to `x = x + 5`. 
`x -= 5` is a shorthand notation for decrementing the value of `x` by 5, which is equivalent to `x = x - 5`.
**Increment using `+=`:**

```javascript
let num = 10;
num += 5; // Equivalent to: num = num + 5;

console.log(num); // Output: 15
```

**Decrement using `-=`:**

```javascript
let num = 20;
num -= 5; // Equivalent to: num = num - 5;

console.log(num); // Output: 15
```
