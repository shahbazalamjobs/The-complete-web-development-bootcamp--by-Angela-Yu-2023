### Alert
- In JavaScript, the `alert()` function is a built-in method that allows you to display a dialog box with a message to the user. The dialog box typically contains an "OK" button, and the message you provide will be shown to the user as a simple notification.

Here's the basic syntax of the `alert()` function:

```javascript
alert(message);
```

- `message`: This is the string or message that you want to display in the alert dialog box.

Example usage:

```javascript
alert("Hello, world!"); // Displays an alert box with the message "Hello, world!"

let age = 25;
alert("Your age is: " + age); // Displays an alert box with the message "Your age is: 25"
```
